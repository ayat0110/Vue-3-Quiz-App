This project is a quiz application built using Vue 3 Composition API. The application contains multiple quizzes related to different lectures. Users can search for quizzes by entering keywords related to the quiz topic. The search functionality is implemented using reactive() and ref() functions from the Composition API.

The project allows users to select and complete any quiz they like. Each quiz has a list of questions, each with multiple options and a correct answer. The user's answers and score are tracked using reactive() and ref() functions.

The application provides an intuitive and responsive user interface built using Vue.js 3.
